# Veteran Suicide Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of suicide among veterans using a decision tree model. The model will consider various factors such as demographics, geographic location, military service details, socioeconomic factors, and health-related factors.

## Objective
The primary goal is to create a predictive model that can identify high-risk groups among veterans and contribute to proactive measures for preventing suicides.

## Data Description
The dataset spans from 2005 to 2011 and contains information about veteran suicides in the United States. Key data points include:

- Demographic information (age, gender, race)
- Geographic location (state, region)
- Military service details (branch, combat experience)
- Socioeconomic factors (employment status, income level)
- Health-related factors (physical injuries, mental health conditions)

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
1. **Data Integration**: Merge individual yearly datasets into a single dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
3. **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant features for the decision tree model.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Statistical Summary**: Descriptive statistics of the data.
2. **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of key trends and relationships.

### Preprocessing
1. **Data Transformation**: Normalize and encode categorical variables.
2. **Train-Test Split**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Model Development
1. **Decision Tree Creation**: Build a decision tree model using the training set.
2. **Parameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters for better performance.

### Model Evaluation
1. **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. **Validation**: Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

### Feature Importance
1. **Analysis**: Identify and analyze the most significant factors contributing to veteran suicides.

## Ethical Considerations
- Ensure sensitive data is handled with confidentiality and respect.
- Be cautious in the interpretation and dissemination of results.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- R (optional, for supplementary analysis)

## Future Work
- Explore additional models and compare their performances.
- Incorporate more granular data, if available.
